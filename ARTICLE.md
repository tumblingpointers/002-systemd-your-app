# Systemd your code that needs to start at boot (Linux)

We come accross a lot of methods to "start my python code on boot". I find systemd to be elegant and use it all the time.

### The subjective beauty in using Systemd

Beauty is subjective. However, if you want some process to run at startup there are a few ways Linux systems will let you do it. Very few ways
will allow you to define a configuration file statically typed, fully-reliable to run processes during boot.
